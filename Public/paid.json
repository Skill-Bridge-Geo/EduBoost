    "description": "Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries."

      "comment": "I haven't finished the course yet, as I would like to have some feedback from the teacher, about the comments I shared on the forum 3 months ago, and I still haven't had any answer. I think the course is well structured, however the explanations and videos are very quick for beginners. However, it is good to go practicing."
